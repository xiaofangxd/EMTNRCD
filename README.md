# EMTNRCD

We provided a matlab implementation for EMTNRCD based on PlatEMO[[PlatEMO](https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO)]. In this code, NSGAII and SparseEA is considered a basic multiobjective optimizer.

## Getting started

git clone https://github.com/xiaofangxd/EMTAUC.git

```

- Install MATLAB.

### Test Suites

We provide two test suites, 'EG' and 'RN', for example.

### Running

- Running test.m.
